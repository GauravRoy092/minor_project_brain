# Brain Tumor Detection

This project focuses on developing an advanced deep learning system for the detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI scans. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the aim is to enhance diagnostic accuracy and streamline clinical workflows

## Tech Stack

**Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch.

**Image Processing:** OpenCV and PIL.

**Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Authors

## Expected Outcomes

**1.** A robust deep learning model for accurate brain tumor detection.

**2.** A deployable tool to enhance radiological diagnostics and improve patient care.




## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  Just Run all Cells with restart Kernel
```
